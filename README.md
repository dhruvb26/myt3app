# My T3 App

I am creating this application as a starter template for my upcoming projects. This way I would have a good foundation to build on top of.

## TODO

- [x] Make it deploy (w/ Vercel)
- [x] Scaffoled basic UI (Landing Page) (w/ ShadCN)
- [x] Add a footer and make the Navbar collapsible
- [ ] Set up a database (w/ Vercel Postgres)
- [ ] Add authentication (w/ Clerk)
- [ ] Error Management (w/ Sentry)

Note: Posthog for analytics, Upstash for ratelimiting
