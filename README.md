# My T3 App

I am creating this application as a starter template for my upcoming projects. This way I would have a good foundation to build on top of.

## TODO

- [x] Make it deploy (w/ Vercel)
- [x] Scaffoled basic UI (Landing Page) (w/ ShadCN)
- [x] Add a footer and make the Navbar collapsible
- [x] Set up a database (w/ Supabase)
- [x] Add authentication (w/ Clerk)

Optionals: Posthog/Plausible for analytics, Upstash for ratelimiting, Sentry for error management
